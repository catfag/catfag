### A famous quote

> "**STOP PROGRAMMING.** If computers are made of silicon and silicon is a rock, then how can rocks *think* and *use logic*? **THEY CANNOT.** We have a tool for using logic. **IT IS CALLED THE BRAIN.** Look at what programmers have been demanding your respect for all this time, with all the gaming PCs and remote controlled sex toys we've built them. THEY HAVE PLAYED US FOR ABSOLUTE FOOLS" — Dionysius of Heraclea
